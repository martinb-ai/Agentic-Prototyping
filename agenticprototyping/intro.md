# Welcome to the Agentic AI Workshop!

This workshop is a five-day deep dive into the world of agentic AI. You will learn to design, build, evaluate, and deploy sophisticated AI agents using the latest models and tools. Each day builds on the last, taking you from foundational concepts to production-ready systems.

## **Day 1: Foundations (LLMs, Prompts, Agent Mindset)**

Day 1 is all about building a strong foundation. We'll cover the core concepts of Large Language Models (LLMs), how to effectively communicate with them through prompt engineering, and how to start thinking like an agent designer.

-   **Key Topics:**
    -   Developer Quickstart (Text & Image APIs)
    -   Prompt Engineering
    -   Model Selection
    -   Agent Design Foundations
-   **Core Reading:**
    -   `0_0_agent_prd`
    -   `1_0_dev_quick_start`
    -   `1_1_prompt_engineering`
    -   `1_2_model_selection`
    -   `2_0_agents_overview`
    -   `2_1_agent_design_foundations`

## **Day 2: Building Agents - From Single to Multi-Agent**

Today, we transition from theory to practice. You will learn to use the OpenAI Agents SDK to build, run, and empower your agents with memory and tools. We'll then scale up to complex multi-agent systems capable of sophisticated collaboration.

-   **Key Topics:**
    -   The OpenAI Agents SDK
    -   Conversational State (Memory)
    -   Function Calling (Tools)
    -   Multi-Agent Handoffs & Orchestration
    -   Visualizing Agent Architectures
-   **Core Reading:**
    -   `2_2_openai_agents`
    -   `2_3_quick_start`
    -   `2_4_building_agents`
    -   `2_5_running_agents`
    -   `1_6_conversational_state`
    -   `1_5_function_calling`
    -   `2_6_tools`
    -   `2_8_handoffs`
    -   `2_12_orchestration`
    -   `2_7_mcp`
    -   `2_14_visualization`
    -   `2_15_agent_output`

## **Day 3: Production Readiness - RAG, Safety & Observability**

Now that you have a functioning agent, it's time to make it robust, reliable, and ready for the real world. We'll focus on giving your agent external knowledge (RAG), ensuring safe behavior (moderation & guardrails), and making its operations transparent (observability).

-   **Key Topics:**
    -   Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
    -   Safety Best Practices & Moderation
    -   Custom Guardrails
    -   Observability & Tracing
-   **Core Reading:**
    -   `1_12_embeddings`
    -   `1_13_retrieval`
    -   `3_0_production`
    -   `3_1_safety`
    -   `1_15_moderation`
    -   `2_11_guardrails`
    -   `2_9_observability`
    -   `3_2_prompt_caching`

## **Day 4: Evaluation & Optimization**

This is where we transform a functional agent into a high-performing one. You will learn how to systematically measure your agent's performance, design robust evaluation suites, and apply advanced techniques to boost accuracy and reliability.

-   **Key Topics:**
    -   Eval-Driven Development
    -   Creating & Running Automated Evals
    -   The Optimization Framework: RAG vs. Fine-Tuning
    -   Evaluating Complex Agentic Architectures
-   **Core Reading:**
    -   `1_14_evals`
    -   `3_6_evaluation_design`
    -   `3_4_accuracy_optimization`

## **Day 5: Demo, Polish, and Roadmap**

The final day is about bringing everything together. You will polish your agent, prepare a compelling demonstration, and plan the future roadmap for your project. We will also look at real-world case studies to see how these concepts are applied in production.

-   **Key Topics:**
    -   The Prototype-to-Production Checklist
    -   Ensuring Reproducibility
    -   Real-World Case Studies & Architectures
    -   Demo Prep & Roadmap Planning
-   **Core Reading:**
    -   `1_3_prototype_to_production`
    -   `3_5_reproducibility`
    -   `4_financial_portfolio_analysis`
    -   `4_insurance_claims`
    -   `4_pharma_rd`
