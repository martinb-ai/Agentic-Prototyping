## 1. Scenario Snapshot

**Problem Space:** Optimizing complex experimental procedures in pharmaceutical R&D, such as improving the synthesis yield of a new drug compound ("XYZ-13") while adhering to strict constraints.

**Users:** Research scientists and lab technicians involved in drug discovery and development.

**Typical Asks:**
- Suggest 3 distinct protocols to increase XYZ-13 yield by ‚â•15% by testing different catalysts, staying under $15k using approved reagents.
- Propose protocols to optimize XYZ-13 yield below 60¬∞C (due to past heat issues), exploring different approved solvents within budget.
- Design two XYZ-13 yield strategies (aiming for ‚â•15%): a. one maximizing potential yield within the $10k.

**Constraints:**
- **Budgetary:** Operate within defined financial limits (e.g., $15,000 per experiment series).
- **Regulatory/Safety:** Use only pre-approved chemicals/reagents and adhere rigorously to safety protocols.
- **Human Oversight:** Final experimental plans must be reviewed and validated by a human expert before execution.

Traditionally, optimizing such experiments involves weeks of manual planning, literature review, iterative benchwork, and analysis. This AI Co-Scientist approach aims to dramatically reduce the cycle time by automating hypothesis generation, protocol design, and preliminary evaluation, enabling scientists to focus on higher-level strategy and final validation. It shifts the scientist's role from manual execution of planning steps to expert oversight and collaboration with the AI.

## 2. Architecture (Multi-Agent Reasoning)

The system employs a multi-agent architecture that emulates a high-performing scientific team. Different AI components, acting in specialized roles (such as ideation, critique, and learning from outcomes), collaborate using various models and tools to execute the workflow.

![Co-Scientist Architecture](coscientist_architecture.png)

### 2.1. Scientist Input & Constraints

The process starts with the scientist defining the goal, target compound, and constraints.

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from agent_utils import Context, call_openai, log_json

# Example Initial Input
user_input = {
    "compound": "XYZ-13",
    "goal": "Improve synthesis yield by 15%",
    "budget": 15000,
    "time_h": 48,
    "previous": "Prior attempts failed at high temp; explore potential catalyst effects."
}
ctx = Context(client=OpenAI(), **user_input)
```

### 2.2. Ideation (o4-mini + Tools)

Multiple o4-mini instances, prompted with different roles (e.g., Hypothesis Agent, Protocol Agent, Resource Agent), generate experimental plans in parallel. Assigning distinct personas encourages diverse perspectives and covers different aspects of the problem simultaneously during the ideation phase.

```python
ROLE_FOCUS = {
    # Hypothesis Agent Prompt
    "hypothesis_agent": """You are a pharmaceutical hypothesis specialist. 
        Focus exclusively on analyzing the compound structure and research goals to generate testable hypotheses. 
        Consider mechanism of action, binding affinity predictions, and potential off-target effects.""",

    # Protocol Agent Prompt
    "protocol_agent"  : """You are a laboratory protocol specialist. 
        Design experimental procedures that will effectively test the provided hypothesis. 
        Focus on experimental conditions, controls, and measurement techniques.""",

    # Resource Agent Prompt
    "resource_agent"  : """You are a laboratory resource optimization specialist. 
        Review the proposed protocol and optimize for efficiency. 
        Identify opportunities to reduce reagent use, equipment time, and overall costs while maintaining scientific validity.""",
}

# Create a structured prompt template for ideation
IDEATION_PROMPT = """You are a pharmaceutical {role} specialist. Your goal is to {goal} for compound {compound}.
Constraints:
- Budget: ${budget}
- Approved reagents only
- Complete within {time_h} hours
- Previous attempts: {previous}
Respond with structured JSON describing your protocol."""
```

```python
import json, logging
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Dict, List, Any, Optional
from dataclasses import asdict
from functools import partial

MODEL_IDEATE   = "o4-mini-2025-04-16"  # o4-mini model for ideation - balances speed and quality

# Configure logging to help with tracking experiment progress and debugging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format="%(message)s")
logging.info(f"Run‚Äëid {ctx.run_id}  Compound: {ctx.compound}")
logging.info(f"Logs will be stored in: {Path('logs') / ctx.run_id}")

def ideation(ctx: Context):
    logging.info("Starting ideation phase...")
    ideas = []
    for role, focus in ROLE_FOCUS.items():
        logging.info(f"Running ideation agent ${role}")
        sys = IDEATION_PROMPT.format(role=role, focus=focus, **ctx.prompt_vars())
        usr = f"Design a protocol to {ctx.goal} within ${ctx.budget}."
        idea = call_openai(ctx.client, MODEL_IDEATE, sys, usr, ctx)
        ideas.append(idea)
    log_json("ideation_done", ideas, ctx)
    return ideas
```

Output:
```bash
Run‚Äëid 9835f69c  Compound: XYZ-13
Logs will be stored in: logs/9835f69c
```

The ideation agents can utilize external tools such as literature_search, chem_lookup (chemical database), cost_estimator, outcome_db (outcome of previous experiments) to ground their suggestions in data. Explicitly enabling and prompting models to use external tools ensures that generated plans are feasible, compliant, and informed by existing knowledge. The model decides when and which tool to call based on the task.

```python
IDEATION_PROMPT += """\nUse the following tools as appropriate:
- Use the `list_available_chemicals` tool to get list of approved reagents.
- Use the `chem_lookup` tool to verify properties of reagents mentioned.
- Use the `cost_estimator` tool to calculate the approximate cost based on reagents and proposed steps.
- Check the `outcome_db` for relevant prior experiments with {compound}"""

```

These tools are defined in agent_utils.py. For purposes of this solution, the tool calls are mocked in tools.py. In a real use case, these tools would call real APIs.

### 2.3. Tournament Ranking (o4-mini / o3)

Generated protocols are compared pairwise based on criteria like expected effectiveness, feasibility, cost, and novelty. Instead of asking a model to score protocols in isolation, providing two protocols at a time and asking for a direct comparison against specific criteria often yields more reliable relative rankings.

This Elo-style ranking identifies the most promising candidates for deeper review.

```python
TOURNAMENT_PROMPT = """
Protocol A: [details...]
Protocol B: [details...]

Compare Protocol A and Protocol B for synthesizing {compound} aimed at {goal}. Score them on:
1. Likelihood of achieving ‚â• 15% yield increase.
2. Practical feasibility (reagents, time).
3. Estimated cost-efficiency (use tool if needed).
4. Scientific novelty/risk.

Return JSON {{"winner": "A"|"B", "justification": "..."}}."""

# This is a mock tourname implementation that only compares the first two protocols
# A real implementation would compare pairs in a tournament bracket style
def tournament(protocols: List[Dict[str, Any]], ctx: Context):
    logging.info("Starting tournament phase...")
    if len(protocols) == 1:
        return protocols[:1]
    a, b = protocols[0], protocols[1]
    sys = TOURNAMENT_PROMPT.format(**ctx.prompt_vars())
    usr = json.dumps({"A": a, "B": b}, indent=2)
    res = call_openai(ctx.client, MODEL_IDEATE, sys, usr, ctx)
    winner = a if res.get("winner", "A").upper() == "A" else b
    log_json("tournament", res, ctx)
    return [winner]

top_proto = tournament(ideas, ctx)[0]
logging.info("Tournament winner picked!")
```

Output:
```bash
Starting tournament phase...
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat_completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Tournament winner picked!
```

In early experiments, we found that asking models to score protocols on a 1-10 scale led to inconsistent results with score compression. The tournament approach solved this by forcing relative judgments that proved more reliable. This mirrors human expert behavior ‚Äî scientists often find it easier to compare two options directly than to assign absolute scores.

### 2.4. Deep Critique & Synthesis (o3)

The top-ranked protocols are passed to o3 for rigorous review. o3 acts like a senior scientist, assessing scientific validity, methodology, safety, budget compliance, and suggesting improvements or synthesizing a final, refined protocol. It may also call tools for verification.

```python
# Deep critique phase using a more powerful model for rigorous review
CRITIQUE_PROMPT = """You are a senior researcher reviewing a proposed synthesis protocol 
for {compound} aiming for {goal}, budget ${budget} using approved reagents. Review the protocol below rigorously:
1. Identify scientific flaws or methodological weaknesses.
2. Assess safety risks and budget compliance (use `cost_estimator` tool if needed).
3. Check for consistency with prior `outcome_db` results if relevant.
4. Suggest concrete improvements or rewrite sections if necessary.
5. Provide a final go/no-go recommendation.

Return JSON {{"revised_protocol": ..., "critique": "...", "recommendation": "go|no-go"}}.

Protocol to Review:
[Protocol details...]
"""

MODEL_CRITIQUE = "o3-2025-04-16"  # o3 model for deep critique

def critique(protocol: Dict[str, Any], ctx: Context):
    logging.info("Starting critique phase...")
    sys = CRITIQUE_PROMPT.format(**ctx.prompt_vars())
    usr = json.dumps(protocol, indent=2)
    crit = call_openai(ctx.client, MODEL_CRITIQUE, sys, usr, ctx)
    log_json("critique", crit, ctx)
    return crit.get("revised_protocol", protocol)

critiqued = critique(top_proto, ctx)
logging.info("Deep critique completed!")
```

Output:
```bash
Starting critique phase...
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat_completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
(Tool) Cost estimator: [{'name': 'Palladium chloride', 'amount': 0.0045, 'unit': 'g'}, {'name': 'Triphenylphosphine', 'amount': 0.013, 'unit': 'g'}, {'name': 'Sodium borohydride', 'amount': 0.0038, 'unit': 'g'}, {'name': 'Potassium carbonate', 'amount': 0.14, 'unit': 'g'}, {'name': 'Triethylamine', 'amount': 0.07, 'unit': 'mL'}, {'name': 'Dimethylformamide', 'amount': 2, 'unit': 'mL'}, {'name': 'Toluene', 'amount': 5, 'unit': 'mL'}], ['100 mL round-bottom flask', 'magnetic stirrer', 'reflux condenser', 'inert gas line'], 24
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat_completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
(Tool) Outcome DB: XYZ-13, None, 5
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat_completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Deep critique completed!
```

We deliberately separate ideation from critique using different models and personas. Having the same model both generate and critique its own work often leads to self-justification rather than objective assessment. The o3 model, acting as a "senior scientist," consistently identified methodological weaknesses that o4-mini missed during ideation.

### 2.5. (Optional) Safety Check

A specialized model, such as gpt-4.1-mini, can perform a final check for specific safety concerns (e.g., hazardous reagent combos).

```python
# Optional safety check using a targeted model
SAFETY_PROMPT = """You are a lab‚Äësafety specialist. 
Identify hazards, unsafe conditions, or compliance issues in this protocol for {compound}. 
Use `chem_lookup` tool if needed. Return JSON assessment."""

MODEL_SAFETY   = "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14"  # gpt-4.1-mini model for safety checks - optimized for instruction following

def safety(protocol: Dict[str, Any], ctx: Context):
    logging.info("Starting safety assessment...")
    sys = SAFETY_PROMPT.format(**ctx.prompt_vars())
    usr = json.dumps(protocol, indent=2)
    assessment = call_openai(ctx.client, MODEL_SAFETY, sys, usr, ctx)
    log_json("safety", assessment, ctx)
    return {"protocol": protocol, "safety": assessment}

secured = safety(critiqued, ctx)
logging.info("Safety check completed!")
```

Output:
```bash
Starting safety assessment...
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat_completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
(Tool) Chemical lookup: Palladium chloride, None
(Tool) Chemical lookup: Triphenylphosphine, None

(Tool) Chemical lookup: Toluene, None
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat_completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Safety check completed!
```

### 2.6. Human Review

The AI-generated final plan is presented to the human scientist via an interface for validation, potential edits, and final approval.

```python
def human_review(safety_package: Dict[str, Any], ctx: Context):
    logging.info("Awaiting human review...")
    protocol = safety_package["protocol"]
    safety_assessment = safety_package["safety"]
    
    print(f"\n=== PROTOCOL FOR REVIEW: {ctx.compound} - {ctx.goal} ===")
    print(f"DETAILS: {json.dumps(protocol, indent=2)}")
    print(f"SAFETY: {json.dumps(safety_assessment, indent=2)}")
    
    while True:
        approval = input("\nApprove for execution? (yes/no): ").lower()
        if approval in ['yes', 'y', 'no', 'n']:
            approved = approval in ['yes', 'y']
            logging.info(f"Protocol {'approved' if approved else 'rejected'}")
            return {"protocol": protocol, "approved": approved}
        print("Please enter 'yes' or 'no'")

human_decision = human_review(secured, ctx)
```

Output:
```bash

### 2.7. Execution & Learning (o3 + Code Interpreter)

Once the human approves, the plan is sent for lab execution. After lab execution, results are fed back into the system. o3 combined with the Code Interpreter analyzes the data, generates insights, and stores structured outcomes (protocol, parameters, results, insights) in a database (Outcome DB). This database informs future ideation cycles, creating a learning loop.

```python
# Simulating execution and analyzing results
ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """You are a data analyst. 
Did the experiment achieve {goal}?  Analyse factors, suggest improvements, and return structured JSON.
"""

def execute_and_analyse(pkt: Dict[str, Any], ctx: Context):
    logging.info("Starting mock execution and analysis...")
    # These are mock results for a lab experiment
    mock_results = {
        "yield_improvement": 12.5,
        "success": False,
        "actual_cost": ctx.budget * 0.85,
        "notes": "Mock execution"
    }
    sys = ANALYSIS_PROMPT.format(**ctx.prompt_vars())
    usr = json.dumps({"protocol": pkt, "results": mock_results}, indent=2)
    analysis = call_openai(ctx.client, MODEL_CRITIQUE, sys, usr, ctx)
    log_json("analysis", analysis, ctx)
    return analysis

# Only proceed to execution if approved by the human reviewer
if human_decision["approved"]:
    summary = execute_and_analyse(human_decision, ctx)
    logging.info("Analysis complete")
else:
    logging.info("Protocol rejected by human reviewer - execution skipped")
    summary = None

Path("output").mkdir(exist_ok=True)
out_path = Path("output") / f"{ctx.run_id}_summary.json"
out_path.write_text(json.dumps(summary, indent=2))
print(f"\nüéâ Completed. Summary written to {out_path}")
```

Output:
```bash

## 3. Model Playbook

Choosing between o4-mini and o3 depends on the task's complexity and required depth. For other tasks, gpt-4.1-mini provides balance between cost and performance, with the more powerful gpt4.1 recommended when greater capability or nuance is needed.

| Task | Start With | Upgrade When... | Escalate To | Rationale |
|------|------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Ideation & Protocol Generation | o4-mini | Hypotheses lack depth or creativity needed for complex chemical synthesis. | o3 | o4-mini rapidly generates diverse protocols cost-effectively. o3 provides deeper scientific reasoning when more nuanced approaches are required. |
| Protocol Ranking | o4-mini | Comparison requires deeper scientific assessment or multi-factor trade-offs. | o3 | Tournament-style ranking with o4-mini efficiently identifies promising candidates. Escalate when subtle scientific validity needs evaluation. |
| Deep Critique & Synthesis | o3 | N/A - Already using the most capable model for this critical task. | N/A | o3 excels at rigorous scientific review, identifying methodological flaws, and synthesizing improvements across complex protocols. This task inherently requires deep reasoning. |
| Safety Assessment | gpt-4.1-mini | Domain-specific hazards require higher accuracy or specialized knowledge. | gpt-4.1 | gpt-4.1-mini offers a good balance of cost and performance for standard safety checks. Escalate to gpt4.1 when higher accuracy or more nuanced reasoning is needed for complex safety risks. |

**Key Insight:**

This use case exemplifies a powerful pattern: using faster, cheaper models (o4-mini) for breadth and initial filtering, then escalating to more powerful models (o3) for depth, critical review, and synthesis. This layered approach optimizes for both creativity/speed and rigor/accuracy, while managing computational costs effectively. The integration with tools is essential for grounding the AI's reasoning in verifiable, real-world data.

## 4. Deployment Notes

Transitioning the AI Co-Scientist from prototype to lab use involves careful planning.

**Cost Control:**
- Implement configurable "modes" (such as Fast, Standard, Thorough) that adjust the number of o4-mini ideation agents, the depth of o3 critique, or the use of optional checks to balance result quality with cost and latency.
- Track token usage per stage (ideation, ranking, critique) and per tool call for fine-grained cost monitoring.

**Observability:**
- Log inputs, outputs, model choices, tool calls/responses, latencies, and token counts for each step.
- Monitor the performance of the tournament ranking and the impact of o3 critiques (such as how often plans are significantly altered or rejected).
- Track user interactions: which plans are approved, edited, or rejected by the human scientist.

**Safety & Compliance:**
- Implement multiple safety layers: constraints in prompts, tool-based checks (such as reagent compatibility via chem_lookup), optional dedicated model checks (gpt-4.1-mini), automated filters (such as for known hazardous combinations), and mandatory human review.
- Ensure tool endpoints (such as internal databases) meet security requirements.

**Rollout Strategy:**
- Begin with retrospective analysis of past experiments, then move to shadow mode (AI suggests plans alongside human planners), followed by limited live use cases with close monitoring before broader adoption.

## 5. Takeaways

- **Model pairing creates synergy:** o4-mini covers more ground quickly; o3 brings precision and depth.
- **Tool integration grounds reasoning in reality:** Real-world data such as chemical costs and safety constraints inform decision-making.
- **Human scientists remain central:** The system empowers experts by removing grunt work‚Äînot by replacing them.
